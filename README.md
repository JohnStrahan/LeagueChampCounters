This is a web application made for CSC 4026, Secure Cloud Programming With Professor Christopher Pitchford, Spring 2024 at Red Rocks Community College.
This application is for use with the video game League of Legends.
The user simply selects a champion from the dropdown list and the application shows three champions that are good against that champion.
The application is written in Python with Flask, Javascript, css and html.

If there is a failure to connect to the database it may be because it has been turned off to prevent AWS costs.
Email me at jjstrahan@student.cccs.edu and I will turn it on for testing.

Thanks for the semester!
